        <b>Happy Birthday.</b><br><br>

        It’s crazy to think it’s been a year of knowing you, with all the insane back and forth, the fights, the tears, and all the happy moments in between. And honestly… I’m still grateful it was you.<br><br>

        Today I just want you to know how grateful I am that we matched back in November. Even if it started out as just a dating app, it’s always felt like it was meant to happen.<br><br>

        I’m really glad you’re in my life. You’ll always be someone special to me.<br><br>

        I hope this year brings you peace, happiness, and everything you’ve been working for.<br><br>

        - Mansi
